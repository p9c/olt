// Package olt is a repository containing tools and widgets for making programming multi-platform
// GUIs in pure Go painless and intuitive.
//
// Most GUI frameworks are burdened with legacy object oriented paradigms, and very different APIs and often complex
// multi-language systems. This is obstructive to the Go programmer, who wants to just use Go for everything.
// Go's syntax and features allow the creation of concise ways of calling and referring to variables and this
// is basically syntactic sugar plus extensible, nice set of primitives for building interfaces.
